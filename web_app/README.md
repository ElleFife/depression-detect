The model needs your help! Detecting depression is *hard*. Robust speech recognition models rely on 100s of hours of audio data. For this reason, I created a [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) app hosted on an [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) instances utilizing [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for storage and batch processing alogrithms.

The good news is that *you* can contribute! Visit www.XXXX.com to become a *data donor*!

Your audio data which will be incorporated in periodic model re-training with a batch algorithm.

The donation process:
1. Record a ~40 second anonymized clip of you speaking a paragraph (and see a cool spectrogram of your audio recording!).
2. Submit an 8 question PHQ-8 depression survey.
